/**
 * In ZIO, layers are values that contain construction logic for services in

 * logging or authentication, and they are used by business logic.
 *
 * A layer is a lot like a constructor, but may have complex initialization
 * or finalization, or may produce more than one service.
 *
 * ZIO has compile-time, type-safe wiring up of layers, which allows you to
 * optionally use ZIO for dependency-injection. The wire-up of layers
 * is done in a resource-safe, failure-aware way, with maximum parallelism
 * to decrease application startup time.
 *
 * Layers bring more power and compositionality to constructors. Although you
 * don't have to make your own layers to benefit from ZIO, layers can make
 * it easier and safer to assemble applications out of modules.
